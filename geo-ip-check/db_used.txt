Logic description
Script geo_ip.py should be run with 2 paramenters : 
./geo_ip.py 10.0.0.1 nocache

or just
./geo_ip.py 10.0.0.1 

1. Request is sent to RIR DB(for example RIPE) to get the detailed and latest assignment information.
Output shows combine information from the Inetnum and Org objects. 
2. Second request checks the maxmind database
3. The range is split into /24 prefixes and all other DBs are also storing the cache files, not not call always REST API (maxmind and RIR is always checked)
4. The API queries are sent to all databases and show the results
